synopsis:
  "Symbolic execution engine and WebAssembly toolkit for research and engineering"
description: """
Owi is an open-source framework for symbolic execution and WebAssembly analysis.
It supports the analysis of programs written in WebAssembly, C, C++, Rust, and Zig.
Owi provides symbolic execution for bug finding, solver-aided programming, test case generation, and program verification.

The framework includes tools for formatting, optimizing, interpreting, validating, and translating WebAssembly modules.
It also provides a generator for random valid WebAssembly modules.

An OCaml library is available to embed WebAssembly modules and import OCaml functions in a type-safe manner."""
