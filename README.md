# [üêå] Owi [![build-badge]][build status] [![coverage-badge]][coverage percentage]

[Owi] is a toolchain to work with WebAssembly. It is written in [OCaml]. It provides a binary with many subcommands:

- [`owi c`]: a bug finding tool for C code that performs symbolic execution by compiling to Wasm and using our symbolic Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi fmt`]: a formatter for Wasm;
- [`owi opt`]: an optimizer for Wasm;
- [`owi run`]: a concrete Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi script`]: an interpreter for [Wasm specification tests];
- [`owi sym`]: a symbolic Wasm interpreter.

It also provides an OCaml library which allows for instance to [import OCaml functions in a Wasm module] in a type-safe way!

## Installation

`owi` can be installed with [opam]:

```shell-session
$ opam install owi
```

If you don't have `opam`, you can install it following the [how to install opam] guide.

If you can't or don't want to use `opam`, you can build the package with `dune build -p owi @install` but you'll first have to install the dependencies by yourself. You can find the list of dependencies in the [dune-project] file.

### Development version

To get the development version:

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:OCamlPro/owi.git
$ cd owi
$ opam install . --deps-only
$ dune build -p owi @install
$ dune install
```

## Quickstart

### Concrete interpretation

Given a file `test/passing/quickstart.wast` with the following content:

<!-- $MDX file=test/passing/quickstart.wast -->
```wast
(module $quickstart
  (func $f
    i32.const 24
    i32.const 24
    i32.add
    drop
  )
  (start $f)
)
```

Running the executable interpreter is as simple as:
```sh
$ dune exec owi -- run --debug test/passing/quickstart.wast
parsing      ...
checking     ...
grouping     ...
assigning    ...
rewriting    ...
typechecking ...
linking      ...
interpreting ...
stack        : [  ]
running instr: call 0
calling func : func f
stack        : [  ]
running instr: i32.const 24
stack        : [ i32.const 24 ]
running instr: i32.const 24
stack        : [ i32.const 24 ; i32.const 24 ]
running instr: i32.add
stack        : [ i32.const 48 ]
running instr: drop
stack        : [  ]
stack        : [  ]
```

If you want to run the file as a [reference test suite script], you can use the `script` command instead of the `run` one. This will allow you to add constructs like assertions and will also link the [spectest module], which provides function for e.g. printing.

If you're interested in the library part of Owi, here's how to get started:

```ocaml
# open Owi;;
# let filename = "test/passing/quickstart.wast";;
val filename : string = "test/passing/quickstart.wast"
# let m =
    match Parse.Module.from_file ~filename with
    | Ok script -> script
    | Error e -> failwith e;;
val m : Text.modul =
...
# let module_to_run, link_state =
    match Compile.until_link Link.empty_state ~unsafe:false ~optimize:false ~name:None m with
    | Ok v -> v
    | Error e -> failwith e;;
val module_to_run : '_weak1 Link.module_to_run =
...
val link_state : '_weak1 Link.state =
...
# let () =
    Log.debug_on := true;
    match Interpret.Concrete.modul link_state.envs module_to_run with
    | Ok () -> ()
    | Error e -> failwith e;;
interpreting ...
stack        : [  ]
running instr: call 0
calling func : func f
stack        : [  ]
running instr: i32.const 24
stack        : [ i32.const 24 ]
running instr: i32.const 24
stack        : [ i32.const 24 ; i32.const 24 ]
running instr: i32.add
stack        : [ i32.const 48 ]
running instr: drop
stack        : [  ]
stack        : [  ]
```

For more, have a look at the [example] folder, at the [documentation] or at the [test suite].

### Symbolic interpretation

The interpreter can also be used in symbolic mode. This allows to find which input values are leading to a trap.

Given a file `test/sym/mini_test.wast` with the following content:

<!-- $MDX file=test/sym/mini_test.wast -->
```wast
(module
  (import "symbolic" "i32" (func $gen_i32 (param i32) (result i32)))

  (func $start (local $x i32)
    (local.set $x (call $gen_i32 (i32.const 42)))
    (if (i32.lt_s (i32.const 5) (local.get $x)) (then
      unreachable
    )))

  (start $start)
)
```

You can run the symbolic interpreter through the `sym` command:
```sh
$ dune exec owi -- sym test/sym/mini_test.wast
Trap: unreachable
Model:
  (model
    (x_0 i32 (i32 6)))
Reached problem!
```

### Spelling and pronunciation

Although the name Owi comes from an acronym (OCaml WebAssembly Interpreter), it must be written as a proper noun and only the first letter must be capitalized. It is possible to write the name in full lowercase when referring to the opam package or to the name of the binary.

The reason we chose this spelling rather than the fully capitalized version is that in French, Owi is pronounced [o‚Äôwi( É)] which sounds like "Oh oui !" which means "Oh yes!". Thus it should be pronounced this way and not by spelling the three letters it is made of.
