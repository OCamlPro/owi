# [üêå] Owi [![build-badge]][build status] [![coverage-badge]][coverage percentage]

[Owi] is a toolchain to work with WebAssembly. It is written in [OCaml]. It provides a binary with many subcommands:

- [`owi c`]: a bug finding tool for C code that performs symbolic execution by compiling to Wasm and using our symbolic Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi conc`]: a concolic Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi fmt`]: a formatter for Wasm;
- [`owi opt`]: an optimizer for Wasm;
- [`owi run`]: a concrete Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi script`]: an interpreter for [Wasm scripts];
- [`owi sym`]: a symbolic Wasm interpreter;
- [`owi validate`]: a validator for Wasm modules;
- [`owi wasm2wat`]: a Wasm binary to text format translater;
- [`owi wat2wasm`]: a Wasm text to binary format translater.

It also provides an [OCaml library] which allows for instance to [import OCaml functions in a Wasm module] in a type-safe way!

We also have [a fuzzer] that is able to generate random *valid* Wasm programs. For now it has not been made available as a subcommand so you'll have to hack the code a little bit to play with it.

‚ö†Ô∏è For now, the optimizer and the formatter are quite experimental. The optimizer is well tested but only performs basic optimizations in an inefficient way. The formatter is mainly used for debugging purpose and is probably incorrect on some cases.

## Installation

`owi` can be installed with [opam]:

```shell-session
$ opam install owi
```

If you don't have `opam`, you can install it following the [how to install opam] guide.

If you can't or don't want to use `opam`, you can build the package with `dune build -p owi @install` but you'll first have to install the dependencies by yourself. You can find the list of dependencies in the [dune-project] file.

### Development version

To get the development version:

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:OCamlPro/owi.git
$ cd owi
$ opam install . --deps-only
$ dune build -p owi @install
$ dune install
```

## Supported proposals

The üêå status means the proposal is not applicable to Owi.

## About

### Talks

- [september 2023]: [ICFP OCaml track]
- [october 2023]: Wasm Research Day organized by the [WebAssembly Research Center] and hosted in Google Munich
- april 2024: [OUPS (OCaml UserS in Paris)]

### Spelling and pronunciation

Although the name Owi comes from an acronym (OCaml WebAssembly Interpreter), it must be written as a proper noun and only the first letter must be capitalized. It is possible to write the name in full lowercase when referring to the opam package or to the name of the binary.

The reason we chose this spelling rather than the fully capitalized version is that in French, Owi is pronounced [o‚Äôwi( É)] which sounds like "Oh oui !" which means "Oh yes!". Thus it should be pronounced this way and not by spelling the three letters it is made of.
