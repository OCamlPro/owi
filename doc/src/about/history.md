# History of Owi

### Spelling and pronunciation

Although the name Owi comes from an acronym (OCaml WebAssembly Interpreter), it must be written as a proper noun and only the first letter must be capitalized. It is possible to write the name in full lowercase when referring to the opam package or to the name of the binary.

The reason we chose this spelling rather than the fully capitalized version is that in French, Owi is pronounced [o’wi(ʃ)] which sounds like "Oh oui !" which means "Oh yes!". Thus it should be pronounced this way and not by spelling the three letters it is made of.
