# Installation

`owi` can be installed with [opam]:

```shell-session
$ opam install owi
# if you intend to use symbolic execution you must install one solver
# you can choose any solver supported by smtml
# z3, colibri2, bitwuzla-cxx or cvc5 for instance
$ opam install z3
```

If you don't have `opam`, you can install it following the [how to install opam] guide.

If you can't or don't want to use `opam`, you can build the package with `dune build -p owi @install` but you'll first have to install the dependencies by yourself. You can find the list of dependencies in the `dune-project` file.

### Development version

To get the development version:

```shell-session
$ git clone git@github.com:OCamlPro/owi.git
$ cd owi
$ opam install . --deps-only
$ dune build -p owi @install
$ dune install
```
